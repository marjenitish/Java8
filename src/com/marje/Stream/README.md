# Stream in Java

1. Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
2. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various 
methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
3. A  stream is not a data structure instead it takes input
from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
4. Streams don't change the original data structure, they only
provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
